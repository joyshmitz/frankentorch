# frankentorch-kgs4.127 - max_pool3d saved-index backward sidecar

Agent: IvoryDeer / cod-b
Date: 2026-06-19
Status: in_progress, code-first batch-test pending

## Workload Trigger

Source profile:

- `artifacts/perf/frankentorch-next-reprofile-20260617/current_top_train_reprofile.log`
- Hot row: `max_pool3d/grad`
- Current timing in that route: `[35.230 ms 36.089 ms 36.992 ms]`
- Benchmark shape: `[N,C,D,H,W]=[2,32,16,32,32]`, `kernel=2x2x2`, `stride=2x2x2`, followed by `tensor_sum(out)` and backward.

The current f64 API path saved the full input tensor in the autograd context and
rescanned windows in backward.

## Lever

Add max-pool3d saved-index sidecars:

1. `max_pool3d_forward_with_indices_f64`: returns output plus plane-local
   first-argmax offsets.
2. `max_pool3d_backward_from_indices_f64`: scatters `dout` through saved
   offsets.
3. `functional_max_pool3d`: saves the compact arg-offset sidecar instead of the
   full `[N,C,D,H,W]` input for f64 grad.

This is distinct from `frankentorch-kgs4.117`, which only unrolled the 2x2x2
rescan loop inside the old input-rescan backward.

Alien mapping:

- Sidecar evidence / memoized search result: move argmax selection to forward
  once, then reuse it in backward.
- Cache-aware context layout: replace a full input save with output-sized
  offsets.
- Communication avoidance: remove backward input-window rescans from the f64 API
  route.

## Correctness Guard

Added `max_pool3d_indices_scatter_matches_rescan_first_tie_bits`.

The guard builds tie-heavy overlapping 3-D windows, verifies sidecar forward
values against the existing forward, and verifies sidecar scatter gradients
bit-for-bit against the existing `max_pool3d_backward_f64` rescan path.

## Negative-Evidence Ledger

| Attempt | Evidence | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MaxPool3d 2x2x2 stride2 unrolled rescan | `artifacts/perf/frankentorch-kgs4.117/code_first_max_pool3d_2x2x2s2_bwd.md`; code-first pending. | Do not repeat unroll-only work; this pass removes the rescan/input save. |
| MaxPool2d borrowed-input tape plumbing | `artifacts/perf/frankentorch-pool2d-borrowed-max/report.md`; same-worker median regressed `99.832 ms -> 108.28 ms`. | Do not retry borrowed-input-only pool plumbing. |
| MaxPool1d direct saved-index route | `artifacts/perf/frankentorch-kgs4.109/closeout_direct_max_pool1d_keep.md`; kept. | Positive adjacent sidecar evidence; this pass extends the sidecar pattern to 3-D. |

If batch Criterion or conformance rejects this patch, do not retry max-pool3d
sidecar saves without a focused profile showing context memory or backward
window rescans still dominate.

## Verification

Required local-only gate:

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankentorch-cod-b cargo check -p ft-api
```

Result: PASS on 2026-06-19.

Not run by instruction: tests, rch, clippy, fmt, Criterion/conformance batch.
