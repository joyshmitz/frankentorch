# Phase-2C Readiness Drill Sign-off V1

Bead: `bd-3v0.11`  
Generated on: `2026-02-17`  
Owner: `WhiteGlacier`

## Decision

Readiness status: **READY (final program gate closure criteria satisfied)**.

Rationale:
- Core quality gates and durability artifacts are green in currently available evidence.
- Runtime durability linkage is now embedded in failure-forensics outputs.
- CI `workflow_dispatch` rerun with `enforce_g8=true` is now concluded `success` on head `5c988e3` (run `22078989645`), satisfying final concluded CI evidence capture for G8.

## Gate Status Snapshot (G1..G8)

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `G1` fmt/lint hygiene | pass | `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target_phase2c cargo fmt --check`; `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target_phase2c cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| `G2` unit/property + structured log contract | pass | `artifacts/phase2c/e2e_forensics/reliability_gate_report_v1.json` (`total_entries=124`, `failed_entries=0`, `unknown_reason_code_count=0`) |
| `G3` differential/metamorphic/adversarial parity | pass | `artifacts/phase2c/conformance/differential_report_v1.json` (`total_checks=284`, `failed_checks=0`, `blocking_drift_count=0`) |
| `G4` e2e replay + forensics completeness | pass | `artifacts/phase2c/e2e_forensics/e2e_matrix_gate_window_v1.jsonl` (124 entries, `FT-P2C-001..008`) + `artifacts/phase2c/e2e_forensics/golden_journey_coverage_v1.json` |
| `G5` perf tails + isomorphism | pass (artifact-backed) | packet `optimization_delta_v1.json` + `optimization_isomorphism_v1.md` under `artifacts/phase2c/FT-P2C-*` |
| `G6` artifact schema + packet lock validation | pass (artifact set present) | packet parity/contract artifacts + schema lock (`artifacts/phase2c/SCHEMA_LOCK_V1.md`) |
| `G7` RaptorQ durability | pass | `artifacts/phase2c/RAPTORQ_REPAIR_SYMBOL_MANIFEST_V1.json`, `artifacts/phase2c/RAPTORQ_INTEGRITY_SCRUB_REPORT_V1.json`, `artifacts/phase2c/RAPTORQ_DECODE_PROOF_EVENTS_V1.json` |
| `G8` readiness sign-off + residual risk | pass | this document + CI dispatch `22078989645` (`workflow_dispatch`, `enforce_g8=true`) concluded `success`: `https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankentorch/actions/runs/22078989645` |

## Residual Risk Register

| Risk ID | Status | Description | Impact | Owner | Follow-up bead |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RSK-P2C-READINESS-001` | resolved | Gate-window packet coverage closure for `FT-P2C-003/005/007/008` completed. | Previously risked understated packet coverage in readiness reports. | `WhiteGlacier` | `bd-3v0.24` (closed) |
| `RSK-P2C-READINESS-002` | resolved | Failure-forensics outputs now include explicit runtime durability ledger + sidecar refs via `runtime_durability_refs` and per-failure `durability` evidence links. | Closed: G7/G8 triage now has direct runtime durability provenance references. | `WhiteGlacier` | `bd-3v0.25` (closed) |
| `RSK-P2C-READINESS-003` | resolved | Expanded gate-window reliability run initially reported unknown reason codes; classifier coverage was extended and rerun now passes with `unknown_reason_code_count=0`. | Previously blocked readiness reliability gating. | `WhiteGlacier` | `bd-3v0.26` (closed) |
| `RSK-P2C-READINESS-004` | resolved | CI workflow-dispatch rerun with `enforce_g8=true` on head `5c988e3` completed successfully (`22078989645`) after prior queue stalls (`22077809024`, `22077962746`). | Final concluded CI evidence for G8 is now present; no remaining queue-starvation blocker for readiness closure. | `WhiteGlacier` | `bd-s4hd` (closed) |

## Closure Criteria for Final G8 Sign-off

1. `bd-3v0.25` closed with runtime durability linkage visible in failure-forensics outputs. ✅
2. CI run of `.github/workflows/phase2c_reliability_gates.yml` with `workflow_dispatch` and `enforce_g8=true` completes successfully. ✅ (`22078989645`, conclusion `success`)
3. `bd-3v0.11` status moved from `in_progress` to `closed` with this sign-off updated to READY. ✅
