## Performance Gauntlet

| `frankentorch-kgs4.143` | BatchNorm2d f32 automatic `tensor_sum` shortcut `[32,256,28,28]` NCHW | mixed-location local-oracle `15.31x` slower ordinary; `13.41x` slower explicit scalar-sum | internal keep; same-worker `vmi1152480` ordinary disabled `166.77 ms` -> enabled `117.96 ms` (`1.41x` faster); explicit scalar-sum control stable `100.95 ms` -> `103.35 ms` | kept; route remaining gap to true forward deforestation, saved-stat/workspace reuse, arena/tape allocation, f32-native storage/layout, and generated scalar-loss kernels |

| `frankentorch-kgs4.138` | BatchNorm1d f64 fused scalar-sum train step `[16,128,256]` NCL | same-host `4.52x` slower | internal keep; local native `11.178 ms` -> scalar-sum `4.7944 ms` (`2.33x` faster); rch same-run scalar/native `25.058 ms` / `43.610 ms` (`1.74x` faster) | kept; route remaining gap to automatic scalar-loss pattern matching, tape/session arena reuse, saved-stat workspace reuse, and algebraic zero-`dx` proof |
| `frankentorch-kgs4.120` | RMSNorm f64 train scalar-sum step `[2048,1024]` | mixed-location `4.88x` slower | no gain; active f64 unit-dy branch `59.289 ms` vs generic-disabled `58.407 ms`, `p=0.55`; final source `64.615 ms`, `p=0.58` | rejected/reverted f64 unit-dy branch; route to automatic scalar-loss fusion, persistent row-stat/workspace reuse, arena allocation, f64-native layout, or generated fused code |

| `frankentorch-kgs4.136` | BatchNorm2d f32 fused scalar-sum train step `[32,256,28,28]` | mixed-location `13.94x` slower | internal keep; rch Criterion `114.23 ms` fused -> `78.166 ms` scalar-sum; direct diagnostic `10.80 ms` fused -> `1.66 ms` scalar-sum | kept; route remaining gap to stats/backward reuse, arena/tape allocation, automatic loss fusion, and f32 storage/layout |
| `frankentorch-kgs4.135` | GroupNorm f32 fused scalar-sum train step `[8,64,28,28]`, groups `32` | direct A/B `5.58x` slower | internal keep; rch direct path `8.30 ms` fused -> `2.10 ms` scalar-sum; Criterion `17.139 ms` materialized -> `8.9874 ms` scalar-sum | kept; route remaining gap to automatic loss fusion, arena/tape allocation, f32 storage/layout, and scheduler work |

| `frankentorch-kgs4.134` | avg_pool1d f64 fused scalar-sum train step `[8,64,8192]` | `7.55x` slower | internal keep; local same-run old `69.267 ms` -> fused `59.050 ms`; rch same-run old `134.74 ms` -> fused `87.564 ms` | kept; route remaining gap to allocation/tape/loss fusion beyond avg_pool1d kernel microlevers |
| `frankentorch-kgs4.142` | avg_pool1d f64 automatic `tensor_sum` shortcut `[8,64,8192]` | mixed-location `104.55x` slower candidate ordinary; `56.58x` slower explicit scalar-sum | no significant gain; same-worker `vmi1153651` ordinary `1.6792 s` -> `1.2016 s`, `p=0.44`; explicit scalar-sum control `810.56 ms` -> `650.33 ms`, `p=0.57` | rejected/reverted; do not retry metadata-only avg_pool1d sum auto-fusion without true forward deforestation or allocator/tape evidence |
| `frankentorch-kgs4.124` | SmoothL1 f64 mean-loss backward, 8M elems | `1.99x` slower | internal keep; `963.16 ms` -> `757.63 ms` on `hz2` | kept; follow-up `frankentorch-kgs4.127` |
| `frankentorch-kgs4.126` | max_pool1d f64 train step `[8,64,8192]` | `12.31x` slower | no gain; candidate median `184.41 ms` vs parent `178.47 ms` | reverted |
| `frankentorch-kgs4.127` | SmoothL1 f64 one-sided input grad, 8M elems | `1.79x` slower | internal keep; same-host local `746.26 ms` -> `647.44 ms` | kept; route remaining gap to tape/allocation/SIMD |
| `frankentorch-kgs4.128` | max_pool3d f64 train step `[2,32,16,32,32]` | `9.38x` slower clean baseline | no gain; borrowed-input median `22.764 ms`, unit-dout median `16.160 ms`, sequential unit-dout median `22.465 ms` | reverted product candidates; keep stage probe |
| `frankentorch-maxpool3d-scalar-loss-grad-buffers-7wru6` | max_pool3d f64 fused sum train step `[2,32,16,32,32]` | baseline `2.46x` slower; accumulate-only candidate `3.02x` slower | no gain; fused median `5.7046 ms`, accumulate-only `5.7846 ms`; raw stage rows regressed | reverted no-report accumulation path |
| `frankentorch-kgs4.133` | conv2d f64 train step `[4,64,64,64]`, 64 3x3 filters | `1.91x` slower; candidate `1.86x` slower | no gain; same-worker rch `121.07 ms` -> `117.92 ms`, `p=0.38`, no change detected | rejected; removed dormant all-ones-dout branch |
| `frankentorch-grefr` | SmoothL1 f64 mean-loss backward, 8M elems | `1.35x` slower | internal keep; direct local `588.51 ms` -> `469.36 ms`; beta=1 derivative branch rejected | kept paired-randn fill; route remaining gap to tape/allocation/loss-kernel |

Measured-discipline score: `28/28` for the gauntlet lanes. PyTorch head-to-head
score: `0W / 27L / 1N`; the RMSNorm scalar-sum comparator is neutral for
release scoring because the candidate was faster than local PyTorch by
mixed-location ratio but failed the same-worker FrankenTorch keep gate.
Correctness guards are green and the SDPA, MaxPool3d,
Linear, LayerNorm, BatchNorm1d/2d, GroupNorm, and SmoothL1 levers include real
internal speedups, but no measured workload is performance-dominant against
PyTorch yet.

### 2026-06-20 BatchNorm2d f32 automatic tensor_sum shortcut keep (`frankentorch-kgs4.143`)

The ordinary f32 training BatchNorm2d scalar-loss call now registers an
autograd-side `tensor_sum` shortcut when output retained gradients and hooks do
not make the materialized output gradient observable. The shortcut reuses the
existing scalar-loss BatchNorm2d backward while preserving fallback behavior for
observable output-gradient edges.

Same-worker `vmi1152480` proof measured the ordinary API path at `166.77 ms`
with the registration temporarily disabled and `117.96 ms` with the final
enabled source, a `1.41x` internal speedup. The explicit scalar-sum control
stayed statistically neutral (`100.95 ms` disabled vs `103.35 ms` enabled), so
the win is on the targeted automatic ordinary path. Local PyTorch `2.12.1+cpu`
measured `7.705096 ms/iter` on the same fixture, so the final ordinary row is
still `15.31x` slower than PyTorch and counts as `0W / 1L / 0N` for this bead.
`ft-api` focused tests, `ft-api` bench check/clippy, `ft-conformance`, and
`git diff --check` passed. `cargo fmt --check -p ft-api` still reports broad
pre-existing rustfmt drift in ft-api benches/examples and old giant-`lib.rs`
hunks; no formatting churn was included in this perf commit.

### 2026-06-20 BatchNorm2d f32 scalar-loss algebraic-zero reject (`frankentorch-kgs4.141`)

The f32 BatchNorm2d scalar-loss backward candidate mirrored the f64 algebraic
identity from `.140`: scalar-sum training BatchNorm has product gradients
`dx = 0`, `dweight = 0`, and `dbias = upstream * batch * spatial`. The temporary
kernel and API contract probes passed after bounding the old dense-reference
residue, but the end-to-end scalar-sum workload did not move enough to keep.

RCH baseline on `vmi1227854` measured materialized `118.47 ms` and scalar-sum
`75.361 ms`; the remote PyTorch arm failed because the worker lacked torch. RCH
after-run landed on `vmi1293453`, where the unchanged materialized row measured
`348.35 ms`, so that run was rejected as cross-worker noise rather than used as
keep/reject proof.

The paired local fallback used a fresh target dir because the requested local
cod-a target contained artifacts from a different nightly and failed with
`E0514`; no cleanup was performed. On the paired target, scalar-sum baseline was
`116.70 ms` and candidate was `115.48 ms`, with Criterion reporting
`p = 0.40` and "No change in performance detected." Local PyTorch `2.12.1+cpu`
median was `7.467156 ms` per iteration, leaving the candidate `15.46x` slower.
The product source and temporary test-contract edits were reverted, and
`ft-conformance` passed on the reverted tree.

### 2026-06-20 BatchNorm1d scalar-loss algebraic-zero keep (`frankentorch-kgs4.140`)

The f64 training BatchNorm scalar-loss backward path now uses the algebraic
identity that the per-channel centered normalized terms sum to zero:
`dx = 0`, `dweight = 0`, and `dbias = upstream * batch * spatial`. This removes
input rereads and dense constant-upstream math from the scalar-loss backward
kernel. The public API and autograd visibility rules from `.139` remain
unchanged; this lever sits inside the existing scalar BatchNorm backward.

Same-worker `vmi1152480` proof used a temporary unpatched retake and final
patched confirmation. Unpatched medians were native `5.6853 ms`, scalar-sum
`5.8463 ms`, and fold-reference `56.777 ms`. Final patched medians were native
`4.6475 ms`, scalar-sum `4.1630 ms`, and fold-reference `54.596 ms`, with
Criterion improvements of `25.382%` native and `30.188%` scalar-sum. That is
`1.2233x` faster for ordinary native call sites and `1.4043x` faster for the
explicit scalar-sum row.

Local PyTorch `2.12.1+cpu`, 32 threads, clone/detach per rep, measured median
`0.956812 ms` on the same NCL f64 scalar-loss fixture. The final patched native
row is still `4.857x` slower than PyTorch, and the explicit scalar-sum row is
still `4.351x` slower. A PyTorch residue probe confirmed only tiny numerical
residue around the zero gradients, so the test contract was updated to assert
exact product zero while bounding dense-reference residue and preserving
bit-exact `dbias`.

Gates: focused `ft-api` tensor-sum tests 2/0, focused `ft-kernel-cpu`
BatchNorm tests 7/0 after the test-contract update and again after the final
manual style fix, full `ft-conformance` green, final `ft-kernel-cpu` check
green, final `ft-kernel-cpu` clippy green, `git diff --check` green, and scoped
UBS with `0` critical issues. Whole-file rustfmt still reports pre-existing
large-file drift outside this lane; the touched BatchNorm assertion hunk was
manually formatted and no longer appears in the rustfmt diff. One prior kernel
test run is intentionally kept as negative evidence because it failed the old
dense-reference exact-bit assumption before the test was corrected.

The earlier same-bead saved-`rstd` source path from `origin/main` is retained in
the negative-evidence ledger as historical proof, but the current product source
is the algebraic-zero path above. After rebasing over that upstream commit, the
focused BatchNorm kernel tests, focused `ft-api` tensor-sum tests, full
`ft-conformance`, and `ft-kernel-cpu` clippy all remained green.

### 2026-06-20 BatchNorm1d automatic tensor_sum shortcut keep (`frankentorch-kgs4.139`)

The ordinary `functional_batch_norm1d(...).tensor_sum()` path now recognizes
f64 training-mode affine BatchNorm1d outputs and replaces the generic Sum
backward edge with a scalar BatchNorm backward shortcut. It falls back to the
materialized `Sum` path when retained grads or tensor hooks make the output
gradient observable.

The corrected RCH baseline (`cargo bench --profile release`; the first
`--release` attempt was invalid for `cargo bench`) selected `hz1` but timed out
during remote sync and fell back locally. That local fallback measured native
ordinary BatchNorm1d+Sum at `[11.129 ms, 11.622 ms, 12.148 ms]`, explicit
scalar-sum at `[4.8402 ms, 5.0014 ms, 5.1322 ms]`, and fold-reference at
`[58.736 ms, 59.337 ms, 60.091 ms]`.

After the automatic shortcut, local same-machine Criterion measured native
ordinary call sites at `[6.3946 ms, 6.6151 ms, 6.7803 ms]`, explicit scalar-sum
at `[5.0390 ms, 5.1754 ms, 5.2503 ms]`, and fold-reference at
`[37.121 ms, 40.052 ms, 42.854 ms]`. The automatic path is `1.76x` faster than
baseline ordinary call sites, but still `1.278x` slower than the explicit
scalar API because it still materializes the BatchNorm output in forward.

RCH after-run evidence on `hz2` measured native automatic `6.0836 ms`, explicit
scalar `4.7261 ms`, and fold `48.006 ms`; because the before row fell back
locally, this is routing evidence rather than same-worker proof. Local PyTorch
`2.12.1+cpu`, 32 threads, clone/detach per rep, measured median `0.891630 ms`.
The local automatic shortcut is still `7.42x` slower than PyTorch.

Gates: focused `ft-api` shortcut tests 2/0, BatchNorm1d API filter 10/0, full
`ft-conformance` green, `ft-autograd` check and clippy green, `ft-api`
check/lib-clippy green. All-target `ft-api` clippy remains blocked by existing
test lint debt outside this change; full-file rustfmt remains blocked by old
large-file drift, but the touched BatchNorm shortcut hunks were manually
formatted and the touched-symbol rustfmt grep is clean. Scoped UBS timed out
after 240s on the giant Rust files with no findings emitted; docs/artifact-only
UBS exited 0 but reported Markdown as no recognizable language.

### 2026-06-20 RMSNorm f64 unit-dy no-ship (`frankentorch-kgs4.120`)

The existing f64 all-ones-`dy` RMSNorm backward branch was batch-verified and
removed. On `vmi1153651`, the active branch measured
`[51.215 ms, 59.289 ms, 67.477 ms]` for
`rms_norm/grad_2048x1024`; the temporary generic-disabled probe measured
`[52.546 ms, 58.407 ms, 64.377 ms]` with no detected change (`p=0.55`), and
the final source after removing the branch/helper/test measured
`[46.294 ms, 64.615 ms, 87.183 ms]` with no detected change (`p=0.58`).
The active branch was `1.0151x` slower than the generic-disabled median.

Local PyTorch CPU `2.12.1+cpu`, 32 threads, clone/detach per rep, measured
`13.241798 ms` median for the same f64 scalar-sum train row. The final
FrankenTorch path is still `4.88x` slower by this mixed-location ratio; the
active rejected branch was `4.48x` slower. Gates passed for full
`ft-kernel-cpu` lib tests (`504 passed; 0 failed; 2 ignored`), API RMSNorm
tests (`6 passed; 0 failed`), strict-scheduler conformance, `ft-kernel-cpu`
check, `ft-kernel-cpu` clippy, `git diff --check`, and scoped UBS with `0`
critical issues. Whole-file rustfmt on the touched giant file remains blocked
by existing unrelated drift, so no broad formatting rewrite was applied.

### 2026-06-20 RMSNorm f32 unit-dy no-ship (`frankentorch-kgs4.123`)

The existing f32 all-ones-`dy` RMSNorm backward branch was batch-verified and
failed hard. On `vmi1149989`, the active branch measured
`[63.618 ms, 67.574 ms, 70.695 ms]` for
`rms_norm/grad_f32_2048x1024`; disabling the branch measured
`[16.839 ms, 18.496 ms, 20.014 ms]`, and the final product source with the
branch/helper/test removed measured `[18.942 ms, 19.613 ms, 20.940 ms]`.
So the active candidate was `3.45x` slower than final source and was removed.

Local PyTorch CPU `2.12.1+cpu`, 32 threads, clone/detach per rep, measured
`10.970112 ms` median for the same f32 scalar-sum train row. The final
FrankenTorch path is still `1.79x` slower by this mixed-location ratio; the
active rejected branch would have been `6.16x` slower. Gates passed for the
f32 API grad parity test, strict-scheduler conformance, `ft-api` bench check,
`ft-api` bench clippy, `ft-kernel-cpu` lib clippy, and scoped UBS with `0`
critical issues. Whole-file rustfmt on the touched giant files remains blocked
by existing unrelated drift, so no broad formatting rewrite was applied.

### 2026-06-20 BatchNorm1d f64 scalar-sum keep (`frankentorch-kgs4.138`)

A dedicated f64 `sum(batch_norm1d(input, running_mean, running_var, weight,
bias))` scalar-loss path now supports both `[N,C]` and native `[N,C,L]`.
It computes the scalar directly and backpropagates scalar upstream gradient
through `batch_norm_backward_scalar_f64`, avoiding the normalized output tensor,
the `tensor_sum` tape node, and the dense all-ones `dy` buffer.

Local same-host Criterion on `[16,128,256]` NCL measured native materialized
BatchNorm1d at `[10.985 ms, 11.178 ms, 11.358 ms]` and scalar-sum at
`[4.6378 ms, 4.7944 ms, 4.9162 ms]`, a `2.33x` internal speedup. Fold-reference
remains `56.986 ms`, so scalar/fold is `0.0841x` (`11.89x` faster). Local
PyTorch `2.12.1+cpu`, 32 threads, prebuilt random fixture plus clone/detach per
rep, measured median `1.061455 ms`; the scalar-sum row is still `4.52x` slower.

RCH routing evidence: baseline native/fold on `vmi1149989` was `7.3230 ms` /
`44.182 ms`. The after run did not honor the requested worker pin and landed on
`vmi1153651`, where same-run native/scalar/fold were `43.610 ms` / `25.058 ms`
/ `190.20 ms`; scalar/native was still `1.74x` faster, but the before/after
worker mismatch makes the local same-host run the primary keep proof.

Gates: f64 scalar-backward kernel tests 2/0, full BatchNorm kernel filter 7/0,
API NCL scalar-vs-materialized proof 1/0, full `ft-conformance` green, scoped
check/clippy green for `ft-kernel-cpu` and `ft-api` bench. Whole-file rustfmt
checks remain blocked by pre-existing formatting drift outside this change.

### 2026-06-20 RMSNorm scalar-sum no-ship (`frankentorch-kgs4.137`)

A dedicated f64 `sum(rms_norm(input, weight))` scalar-loss candidate removed
the normalized output allocation, the `tensor_sum` tape node, and dense
all-ones upstream allocation, but did not clear the same-worker A/B gate.
On `vmi1227854`, the materialized baseline was `[11.683 ms, 12.229 ms,
12.596 ms]`. The candidate run measured the existing materialized row at
`[11.334 ms, 12.086 ms, 13.179 ms]` with no detected change (`p=0.61`) and
the scalar-sum row at `[11.023 ms, 12.329 ms, 13.944 ms]`. That is `1.020x`
slower than materialized in the same run and `1.008x` slower than baseline.

Remote PyTorch was unavailable on rch workers (`No module named 'torch'`).
The local PyTorch `2.12.1+cpu` comparator, 32 threads with clone/detach per
rep, measured median `14.360424 ms`, so the mixed-location scalar/PyTorch
ratio was `0.8586x`. That ratio is recorded but not release-counted because
the product candidate lost to the existing FrankenTorch path. Focused
candidate-branch tests passed (`ft-kernel-cpu` scalar backward 6/0,
`ft-api` RMSNorm scalar-sum 2/0), strict-scheduler conformance passed 1/0,
`ft-api` and `ft-kernel-cpu` all-target checks passed, and `cargo fmt --check`
passed. All-target clippy remains blocked by existing broad lint debt, and no
source from this lane was shipped.

### 2026-06-19 root-cause — the pooling-train-step losses are the generic backward machinery (`frankentorch-96e5d`)

A phase-timing probe (`crates/ft-api/examples/avgpool1d_phase_timing.rs`) shows the
`avg_pool1d [8,64,8192]` 25.86x gap (`kgs4.122`) is ~75% in `tensor_backward`
(~70–134 ms) while the raw pooling kernels are ~3 ms; a control `sum(x).backward()`
on the same 4 M leaf with NO pooling op is 35–53 ms. So the gap is the generic autograd
backward machinery (fresh multi-MB grad/contrib alloc + first-touch page faults + serial
bandwidth-bound copy), NOT the kernel — which is why the `kgs4.122`/`kgs4.126` pooling
KERNEL fast paths were correctly reverted. Shipped one bit-exact, can't-regress slice:
`Sum`/`Mean` backward now accumulate the constant gradient lazily (no materialized
`vec![scalar; numel]`); same-process same-worker A/B = `13.73x` on the eliminated
contribution. The remaining ≥2x lever is a backward grad-buffer caching allocator
(`frankentorch-cbe4t`). Gates: ft-autograd 476/0, conformance 199/0 + all sub-suites,
clippy clean.

Forward half (`frankentorch-0w3ns`): `apply_function` clones every input (33 MB on the
`[8,64,8192]` lane) before the kernel; avg_pool1d/max_pool1d backwards never read the
input, so both f64 forwards were routed through the zero-copy
`tensor_apply_function_f64_borrowed_forward` (same accepted pattern as kgs4.119/132).
Same-process A/B (clone+kernel vs borrow+kernel, m=4M): `5.89x` mean / `9.05x` min; the
avg_pool1d forward phase fell ~20 ms → ~6.8 ms. Bit-exact, can't-regress. Gates: ft-api
avg_pool1d 7/0 + max_pool1d 1/0, conformance 199/0 + all sub-suites, clippy clean.

First-contribution backward slot slice (`frankentorch-cbe4t`): `TensorTape` now delays
per-node gradient buffer materialization until the first contribution, preserving the
old `0.0 + contribution` bit semantics and the public zero-gradient fallback for
reachable requires-grad nodes. Local PyTorch-enabled `avg_pool1d` train row improved
FT median `89.360 ms -> 70.206 ms` (`21.4%` faster); PyTorch was `6.7081 ms` baseline
and `6.9328 ms` candidate, so the FT/PyTorch loss narrowed from `13.32x` to `10.13x`
slower. Remote `rch` workers lacked Torch; same-worker `ovh-a` FT-only row was
statistically neutral despite a lower median. Gates: ft-autograd 476/0, ft-api
avg_pool1d bit regression 1/0, strict scheduler conformance 1/0, ft-autograd clippy
clean.

Owned-grad move (`frankentorch-kwarf`): the cbe4t lazy slot's first-contribution path
still did `reserve + push(0.0+v)` (fresh alloc + copy). The CustomFunction backward arm
(avg_pool/max_pool/conv/norms/every elementwise `apply_function` op) hands the engine an
owned, cache-hot `din` Vec; `accumulate_tensor_gradient_owned` now MOVES it into the slot
on first contribution (in-place `-0.0->+0.0` normalize, bit-identical), eliminating the
alloc + copy. Same-process A/B (m=4M f64 = avg_pool1d din, 60 reps): OLD alloc+copy
`9804 us` -> NEW normalize+move `1211 us` = **8.10x** on the eliminated work. Traffic/
allocation reduction → core-count-independent, unlike parallelism levers which are dead in
the cgroup-capped ~10-core rch exec sandbox (`available_parallelism`=10 even on 64-core
hosts; see NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE 2026-06-20b). Gates: ft-autograd 476/0, conformance 199/0 +
all sub-suites, clippy clean. Commit `8191f4ae`.

Fused avg_pool1d scalar-sum (`frankentorch-kgs4.134`): a dedicated
`functional_avg_pool1d_sum` f64 path computes the pooled scalar sum directly and
backprops scalar upstream gradient without materializing the pooled output
gradient buffer. Local PyTorch-enabled gauntlet improved the same-run
FrankenTorch row from `69.267 ms` to `59.050 ms` (`1.17x` faster), while PyTorch
was `7.8192 ms`, so the candidate remains `7.55x` slower. rch `vmi1152480`
Rust-only gauntlet moved `134.74 ms` -> `87.564 ms` (`1.54x` faster); remote
PyTorch is still unavailable because workers lack `torch`. Gates: ft-kernel-cpu
avg_pool1d sum 1/0, ft-api avg_pool1d sum 1/0 plus integration filters,
ft-conformance full suite green, ft-kernel-cpu/ft-api clippy clean.

Automatic avg_pool1d `tensor_sum` scalar shortcut (`frankentorch-kgs4.142`):
the metadata-only auto-fusion candidate compiled and passed focused retain-grad
and output-hook fallback tests, but it did not clear the same-worker keep gate.
On `vmi1153651`, ordinary median moved `1.6792 s -> 1.2016 s` with
`p=0.44`, while the explicit scalar-sum control moved `810.56 ms -> 650.33 ms`
with `p=0.57`; Criterion reported no change for both. Local PyTorch median was
`11.493027 ms`, so the mixed-location candidate ordinary row was still
`104.55x` slower. Source was reverted; the next avg_pool1d attempt must avoid
materializing the pooled forward tensor itself or attack tape/allocation with
cleaner evidence.

Conv3d sum-loss backward (`frankentorch-kgs4.118`): existing code-first f64 all-ones
`dout` fast path is now batch-verified. Same-worker `ovh-a` parent baseline
`29.723 ms` -> current `26.595 ms` (`1.12x` faster, `10.5%` lower median) on
`ops_bench` `conv3d/grad`, with non-overlapping intervals. Same-shape local PyTorch
CPU remains much faster at `7.593859 ms`, so current FT/PyTorch is still `3.50x`
slower. Gates: ft-kernel-cpu conv3d 2/0, ft-api conv3d 10/0, strict scheduler
conformance 1/0.

GroupNorm f32 unit-dy (`frankentorch-kgs4.115`): existing code-first f32 all-ones
`dy` fast path is now batch-verified. Same-worker `hz1` parent baseline at
`e1927d48` fused `19.13 ms` -> current `11.72 ms` (`1.63x` faster) on
`group_norm_f32_grad_ab`; current composed-vs-fused diagnostic is `101.96 ms`
-> `11.72 ms` (`8.70x`). Local PyTorch CPU `2.12.1+cpu` remains much faster at
`0.615446 ms` best-of-12, so current FT/PyTorch is still `19.04x` slower.
Gates: ft-kernel-cpu f32 unit-dy guard 1/0, ft-api f32 grad parity 1/0, strict
scheduler conformance 1/0.

GroupNorm f32 scalar-sum (`frankentorch-kgs4.135`): a dedicated affine
`functional_group_norm_sum` path computes the scalar loss directly and uses a
scalar upstream backward helper instead of materializing the output tensor,
`tensor_sum` node, and dense all-ones `dy`. The direct rch A/B row improved the
existing fused path from `8.30 ms` to `2.10 ms` (`3.96x` faster), and Criterion
moved the materialized median from `17.139 ms` to `8.9874 ms` (`1.91x` faster).
Local PyTorch CPU `2.12.1+cpu` with prebuilt tensors and clone/detach per rep
still has best `0.376163 ms`, so the direct scalar-sum row is `5.58x` slower.
Gates: ft-api scalar-sum tests 2/0, ft-kernel-cpu unit-dy guard 1/0, strict
scheduler conformance 1/0, lib clippy clean for ft-api and ft-kernel-cpu.

BatchNorm2d f32 scalar-sum (`frankentorch-kgs4.136`): a dedicated affine
`functional_batch_norm2d_sum` path computes the scalar loss directly and uses a
scalar upstream backward helper instead of materializing the normalized output,
`tensor_sum` node, and dense all-ones `dy`. The direct rch A/B diagnostic moved
the existing fused path from `10.80 ms` to `1.66 ms` (`6.50x` faster). On the
full PyTorch gauntlet shape, rch Criterion moved the existing fused row from
`114.23 ms` to `78.166 ms` (`1.46x` faster). Remote PyTorch remains unavailable
on rch workers (`No module named 'torch'`), so the PyTorch ratio uses the local
CPU oracle: PyTorch averaged `5.605736 ms/iter`, leaving the scalar row
`13.94x` slower. Gates: ft-kernel-cpu scalar-backward guards 2/0, ft-api
scalar-sum tests 2/0, strict scheduler conformance 1/0, scoped check/clippy
clean.

LayerNorm unit-dy (`frankentorch-kgs4.116`): existing code-first f64/f32
all-ones `dy` fast path is now batch-verified. Same-worker `hz2` parent
baseline at `2aa78200` `layer_norm/grad_2048x1024` `90.723 ms` -> current
`29.606 ms` (`3.06x` faster). Supporting f32 composed-vs-fused diagnostic is
`1930.66 ms` -> `293.49 ms` (`6.58x`). Local PyTorch CPU `2.12.1+cpu` remains
faster at `8.261743 ms` median for the same f64 shape, so current FT/PyTorch is
still `3.58x` slower. Gates: ft-kernel-cpu LayerNorm unit-dy guards 2/0, ft-api
functional LayerNorm 7/0, strict scheduler conformance 1/0 after canceling a
stale-progress `vmi1264463` run and retrying on `hz2`.

Conv2d all-ones dout (`frankentorch-kgs4.133`): the parked f64
`conv2d_backward_f64` candidate that collapses all-ones `dout` into one shared
`dweight` row and one shared `dpanel` row did not clear the same-worker keep
gate. On `vmi1152480`, current `ops_bench` `conv2d/grad_hw/64` was `121.07 ms`;
the active candidate was `117.92 ms`, but Criterion reported
`[-7.9705% -2.5970% +2.8489%]`, `p=0.38`, and no detected change. Local PyTorch
CPU `2.12.1+cpu` median for the same f64 scalar-sum train row was `63.449849 ms`,
so current FT/PyTorch is `1.91x` slower and the no-ship candidate remained
`1.86x` slower. The dormant branch was removed from product source.

MaxPool3d scalar-loss accumulation
(`frankentorch-maxpool3d-scalar-loss-grad-buffers-7wru6`): a no-report
`tensor_backward_accumulate` path that moved only leaf/`retain_grad` buffers
into persistent `.grad` did not move the fused max_pool3d sum-loss row. Baseline
`pytorch_gauntlet_bench` fused median was `5.7046 ms` against PyTorch
`2.3231 ms` (`2.46x` slower). The candidate median was `5.7846 ms` against
same-run PyTorch `1.9164 ms` (`3.02x` slower), while raw kernel
forward+indices regressed `+11.695%` and raw kernel backward-from-indices
regressed `+15.953%`. The source hook was reverted.

Known caveat: `cargo fmt --check -p ft-api` remains blocked by pre-existing
crate-wide formatting debt in unrelated examples and long `ft-api/src/lib.rs`
regions. `cargo fmt -p ft-api -- --check` also reports broad existing drift
for the SmoothL1 closeout; follow-up `frankentorch-6xsy8` tracks that cleanup.

UBS caveat: a full changed-file UBS scan including the 136k-line
`ft-api/src/lib.rs` did not complete after several minutes and was interrupted
or timed out in the pre-commit hook. The max_pool1d benchmark surface was
scanned directly and passed with zero critical or warning findings; no UBS
verdict was available for the SmoothL1 `ft-api/src/lib.rs` closeout.

## Next Perf Target

The `.124` result points toward deeper SmoothL1 training overhead: tape setup,
input/materialization cost, loss backward kernel shape, SIMD, and cache layout.
The `.113` result rejects SDPA post-GEMM scale streams and keeps scaled GEMM
alpha, but the remaining PyTorch gap should move to whole-row scheduling,
cache-blocked softmax/GEMM interaction, f32-native ratio work, arena/tape
allocation removal, or fused loss/backward primitives rather than another
post-scale cleanup.
The `.134` result narrows avg_pool1d with scalar-loss fusion, but the remaining
`7.55x` PyTorch loss should move to a general fused-loss/backward family,
persistent gradient/tape allocation, or whole-row `.grad` traffic removal rather
than another avg_pool1d kernel-only branch.
The `.114` result rejects f32 BatchNorm all-ones-`dy` as a local branch. Route
BatchNorm to fused scalar-loss, saved-stat reuse, persistent workspaces,
stats+backward fusion, arena/tape allocation, or cache-blocked f32 reductions
with same-worker proof.
The `.116` result verifies the LayerNorm unit-dy branch as a real internal win,
but the remaining `3.58x` PyTorch gap should move beyond constant-gradient
normalization branches to whole-row allocation/tape/loss fusion, persistent
normalization workspaces, deterministic parallel affine-gradient reductions,
and f32-native end-to-end rows.
The `.112` result verifies the current avg_pool2d 2x2s2 specialization but
rejects direct assignment scatter writes; the remaining gap should move to
whole-workload tape/allocation/sum-backward overhead, native f32 layout, or a
fused avg-pool training primitive with fresh ratio evidence.
The `.127` result proves that avoiding the unused target gradient allocation is
worthwhile, but the remaining SmoothL1 row is still PyTorch-bound; the next
SmoothL1 attempt should attack allocation lifetime, RNG/input setup, tape edges,
or vectorized branchless gradient generation rather than another scalar wrapper.
The `.122` result points away from tiny avg_pool1d unit-gradient fill branches
and toward end-to-end pooling overhead, especially session/tape setup,
allocation churn, forward materialization, and generic pooling dispatch costs.
The `.126` result points away from tiny max_pool1d backward scatter branches and
toward larger full-step costs: autograd/session setup, allocation churn, and
forward saved-index materialization. The `.117` result keeps compact max_pool3d
sidecars as an internal win but leaves a roughly 10x PyTorch gap, so the next
pooling pass needs an end-to-end profile rather than another sidecar-only tweak.
The `.121` result points away from moving the all-ones linear backward shortcut
into the generic CPU kernel; the remaining gap is end-to-end linear training
overhead, not the already-collapsed row-sum/copy helper alone. Future work
should profile those frames before trying another scalar-wrapper or one-off
unit-gradient branch. The `.128` result rejects borrowed-input-only max_pool3d
autograd and standalone unit-`dout` scatter branches; the next viable route is
end-to-end fusion that removes the sum-generated gradient buffer/tape edge,
allocator/arena work proven on the whole training row, or a fundamentally
different layout/kernel plan with fresh ratio evidence.
The `.133` result rejects materialized-im2col conv2d all-ones row collapse:
the constants and allocations ate the theoretical win. The next conv2d attempt
should avoid this family unless a fresh profile proves a new primitive, such as
direct no-panel all-ones backward, workspace-backed panel reuse, cache-blocked
col2im, or fused loss/backward/tape work, moves the full train row.
The `7wru6` result rejects max_pool3d report-skipping/persistent-grad-only API
work. The next max_pool3d attempt should be a true fused loss/backward primitive
or a scheduler/arena rewrite with same-worker proof on the full PyTorch gauntlet
row, not another wrapper around the generic backward report path.
The `.119` result keeps borrowed Conv3d autograd inputs as a real same-worker
win, but the row still loses to PyTorch by `2.38x`; the next Conv3d pass should
target whole-row autograd/tape allocation, scalar-loss gradient materialization,
persistent workspaces, or a direct fused Conv3d sum-backward primitive rather
than revisiting saved-input copy removal.
